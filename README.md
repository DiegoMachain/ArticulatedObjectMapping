# Learning-based Articulated Object Mapping with the HoloLens

## Abstract

This work uses Ditto: Building Digital Twins of Articulated Objects from Interaction to create a segmented mesh reconstruction of articulated objects, along with axis parameters for prismatic or rotational joints. Ditto needs two distinct inputs as point clouds from the object, where one input is at rest state and the other 
after interacting with the mobile part of the object. The scanning is performed using the HoloLens 2, joint axis result from Ditto can be seen in the HoloLens for a double check and correction. Finally, a URDF model of the object is saved.
